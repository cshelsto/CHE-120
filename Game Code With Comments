"""Pong, classic arcade game.

Exercises

1. Change the colors.
2. What is the frame rate? Make it faster or slower.
3. Change the speed of the ball.
4. Change the size of the paddles.
5. Change how the ball bounces off walls.
6. How would you add a computer player?
6. Add a second ball.

from random import choice, random #CS: Imports choice and random functions from Python's random module. Does so because choice will randomly pick element from a list (used for balls direction), and random with generate float between 0 and 1 (used for ball's speed).
from turtle import * #CS: Imports all of the functions from turtle module. Using * imports every function in turtle. Will be used to draw graphics for game (paddle, ball, etc)

from freegames import vector #CS: imports vector from freegames module. Vector represents 2D points or directions, which will be used in the ball's movements.

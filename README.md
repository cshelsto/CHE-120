# CHE 120 Project
This game was developed as a final project for Computer Literacy and Programming for Chemical Engineers by Corey Shelston and Sejal Atodaria. 

Our game is a twist on the classic game Pong, introducing several changes: 
* Introduction of colours 
* Two balls instead of one 
* Introduction of scoreboard and winning score
* Increased ball speed
* Added obstructions in the middle of the screen

We hope you enjoy playing our version of Pong!
